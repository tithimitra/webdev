    <li><strong>1937</strong>-she took her Final Profession of Vows to a life of poverty, chastity and obedience. As was the custom for Loreto nuns, she took on the title of "Mother"<br> upon making her final vows and thus became known as Mother Teresa.</li>
    <li><strong>1950</strong>- Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious congregation that had over 4,500 nuns.</li>
    <li><strong>1979</strong>-She got Nobel Prize.</li>
    <li><strong> 1997</strong>-After several years of deteriorating health, including heart, lung and kidney problems, Mother Teresa died on September 5, 1997, at the age of 87.</li>
    <li><strong>2002</strong>- the Vatican recognized a miracle involving an Indian woman named Monica Besra, who said she was cured of an abdominal tumor through Mother<br> Teresa's intercession on the one-year anniversary of her death in 1998. </li>
    <li><strong>2003</strong>-She was beatified (declared in heaven) as "Blessed Teresa of Calcutta" on October 19, 2003 by Pope John Paul II.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Heres some famous quots of Mother Teresa</h3>
    <p>"We ourselves feel that what we are doing is just a drop in the ocean. But the ocean would be less<br> because of that missing drop."<br><br>
      "Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love."<br><br>
